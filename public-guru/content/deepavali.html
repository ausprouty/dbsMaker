<h1 class="dbs">Deepavali and the Light of Lord Jesus</h1>

<p>
  Deepavali is a time when homes and hearts are filled with light. It is a
  season of reflection — on hope, renewal, and the longing for what brings peace
  within.
</p>

<p>
  Many people find that this search for light is also a spiritual one. In the
  teachings of Lord Jesus, light is often used to speak about life, truth, and
  freedom from what weighs us down.
</p>

<p>Lord Jesus said:</p>

<blockquote>
  “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but
  will have the light of life.”
</blockquote>

<p>
  Lamps lit during Deepavali remind us that light is not only something we see,
  but something we seek. In the life of Lord Jesus, many have found a light that
  speaks to inner burdens — fear, guilt, restlessness, and longing for peace.
</p>

<blockquote>
  “In him was life, and that life was the light of all people. The light shines
  in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”
</blockquote>

<p>
  In many traditions, the present age is understood as a time of confusion and
  struggle. The teachings of Lord Jesus speak of hope beyond this — of a future
  shaped by peace, restoration, and enduring light.
</p>

<p>
  Lord Jesus also invites those who feel weighed down to come to him — not with
  demands, but with honesty:
</p>

<blockquote>
  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart,
  and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
  light.”
</blockquote>

<p>
  During Deepavali, many pause to reflect on the light they are seeking. If you
  wish, you can take a moment to reflect or pray using the words below.

<blockquote>
  Lord Jesus, you have spoken of light that brings life and peace. If you are
  near, help me to see clearly. Lift the burdens I carry within, guide me in the
  way of peace, and lead me toward the light that brings rest to the soul.
