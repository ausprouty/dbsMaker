<h1 class="dbs">Facilitator’s Tips</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    Try to follow the questions in order each time you meet. The structure helps
    groups stay focused and makes it easier for others to lead similar
    discussions in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    You do not need to do all the talking. Invite different people to read
    questions, share observations, or help guide the discussion so that everyone
    participates.
  </li>
  <li>
    A group can start with just two people. What matters most is creating a safe
    space where people can read, think, and talk honestly together.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="dbs">LOOK BACK</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    This section helps people reflect on their week. Encourage honest sharing
    about what they tried, what was difficult, and what they are thankful for.
    The goal is reflection, not pressure or performance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="dbs">LOOK UP</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Keep bringing the conversation back to the passage itself. When someone
    shares an idea, you can gently ask, “Where do you see that in the text?” so
    the group learns to observe carefully.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is okay if people notice different things or disagree. The focus is on
    what the passage says and how people understand it, not on finding the
    “right” answer.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the group is quiet, you can invite participation by asking someone by
    name, while making it clear that it’s always okay to pass.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="dbs">LOOK FORWARD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    This section invites people to consider whether the passage connects with
    real life. Some may see a personal takeaway; others may simply reflect or
    listen. Both responses are welcome.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the questions mention “Christ,” this is another name used for Jesus.
    People are free to explore what the passage suggests about him and decide
    for themselves what they think.
  </li>
</ul>
