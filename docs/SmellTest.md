# Exploration Smell Test

_Use this quick check before publishing any Exploration content._

A **smell test** is a fast instinct check to catch language that quietly drifts
from **inviting discovery** into **explaining or persuading**.

If something feels slightly uncomfortable to read aloud to a curious friend,
pause and run this test.

---

## 1. The Outsider Read

Read the text as someone with **no church background**.

Ask:

- Would I feel safe joining this?
- Am I allowed to disagree?

🚩 Smells off if:

- Belief is assumed
- Outcomes are promised
- It sounds like recruitment

---

## 2. The Question Ratio

Scan for **statements vs questions**.

Ask:

- Are we inviting discovery, or explaining conclusions?

🚩 Smells off if:

- It explains what Jesus or God does
- It tells readers what the Bible shows
- It gives answers before conversations begin

---

## 3. The Authority Test

Look for hidden authority language.

🚩 Smells off if you see:

- “God calls…”
- “We must…”
- “The Bible teaches…”
- “Jesus shows us that…”

Preferred language:

- “We’ll explore…”
- “These stories raise questions about…”
- “We’ll discover together…”

---

## 4. The Front-Door Test

Ask:

- Is this **front-door language** or **kitchen-table language**?

🚩 Smells off if:

- It sounds like a sermon introduction
- It includes conclusions meant for later discussion
- It would feel awkward in a café invitation

---

## 5. The Translation Test

Read it slowly and imagine it translated.

Ask:

- Would this work in another language or culture?

🚩 Smells off if:

- It relies on idioms
- It uses abstract theology
- It stacks multiple ideas into one sentence

---

## One-Sentence Shortcut

> Could I invite a friend using only this sentence — without explaining or apologising?

If yes → it’s clean.
If no → something smells off.

---

**Goal:**
Front door wide → living room honest → kitchen table deeply Christian.
