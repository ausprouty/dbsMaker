# Exploration Style Guide

_(MyLanguage / DBS Platform)_

This style guide defines how we describe, invite people into, and write content for an **Exploration**.
An Exploration is a series of guided conversations designed for people with mixed beliefs.

---

## 1. What We Mean by “Exploration”

An **Exploration** is:

- relational, not academic
- conversational, not lecture-based
- discovery-oriented, not expert-led
- safe for Christians and non-Christians
- repeatable by ordinary people

**Avoid language that implies:**

- prior knowledge
- correct answers
- authority figures
- pressure to agree

---

## 2. Standard Terminology

### Use (Standardized)

- **Exploration** — the overall series
- **Conversation** — each individual session
- **Group** — the people exploring together
- **Discover** — what participants do together
- **Reflect** — personal or group response
- **Practice** — optional lived-out response

### Avoid

- Study
- Lesson (user-facing)
- Class
- Course
- Curriculum
- Teaching (as a noun)

> _Note:_ Internal code may still use `study` for stability, but never surface this word to users.

---

## 3. Tone and Voice

### Tone

- Warm
- Curious
- Respectful
- Non-coercive
- Honest about tensions

### Voice

- Use **“we”** and **“together”**
- Ask questions more than make statements
- Describe Jesus as someone to listen to, not someone to obey (at the invitation stage)

---

## 4. Summary Writing (Index Page)

### Purpose

To help someone decide:

> “Would I feel safe joining this?”

### Guidelines

- 1–2 short sentences
- Focus on human experience
- No assumed beliefs
- Avoid insider Christian language

### Good Example

> _Money shapes what we value and who we trust.
> This exploration looks at generosity, security, and meaning through real-life questions and the teachings of Jesus._

### Avoid

- “God calls every believer…”
- “We must obey…”
- “Biblical principles show us…”

---

## 5. Introduction Paragraphs (Series Page)

### Structure

Use **two short paragraphs**:

#### Paragraph 1 — Shared Human Experience

- Name common tensions
- Acknowledge struggle or uncertainty
- Avoid answers

#### Paragraph 2 — Invitation to Explore Jesus’ Perspective

- Introduce Scripture gently
- Emphasize discovery, not agreement
- Explicitly welcome mixed beliefs

### Example Pattern

**Para 1:**

> Most of us feel tension around money — between security and generosity, fear and trust.

**Para 2:**

> In this exploration, we’ll look at stories and teachings from the Bible, especially from Jesus, and discover together what they might mean for real life.

### Belongs Here
