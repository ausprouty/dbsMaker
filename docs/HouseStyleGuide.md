# House Style Guide

## Study-Level Text (Titles, Summaries, Introductions)

---

## 1. Purpose of Study-Level Text

Study-level text exists to:

- Invite participation
- Set tone and posture
- Create curiosity
- Reduce fear or resistance

Study-level text does **not** exist to:

- Teach conclusions
- Explain theology
- Motivate obedience
- Summarise outcomes

> **Rule of thumb:** > _If the text answers the study’s questions before Scripture is read, it doesn’t belong here._

---

## 2. Voice & Posture

### Write as:

- A **host**, not a teacher
- An **invitation**, not a directive
- A **guide to a journey**, not a lecturer

### Avoid the voice of:

- Trainer manuals
- Sermons
- Mission strategy documents
- Christian marketing copy

---

## 3. Allowed Length (Hard Limits)

### Study Title

- **1–3 words**
- Nouns or short phrases
- No verbs if possible

Examples:

- ✅ _Disciple_
- ❌ _Becoming a Disciple_

---

### Study Summary (Index Page)

- **1 sentence**
- **Maximum 20 words**
- Ends with a question or open phrase if possible

Examples:

- ✅ _What did Jesus invite His followers into—and what might that mean today?_
- ❌ _This study will help you understand biblical discipleship and apply it to your life._

---

### Study Introduction (Above Lesson Selector)

- **1 short paragraph**
- **2–3 sentences maximum**
- No application language

Examples:

- ✅ _Jesus often spoke about following Him using stories, images, and strong words. This study explores those moments._
- ❌ _Jesus commands all believers to follow Him fully and help others do the same._

---

## 4. Language Rules

### Prefer:

- Concrete images
- Narrative language
- Observational phrasing
- Questions

Examples of preferred wording:

- “moments”
- “stories”
- “words Jesus used”
- “what we notice”

---

### Avoid:

- Abstract Christian jargon
- Institutional language
- Outcome-focused wording

Avoid words such as:

- disciple-making
- multiplication
- obedience (at study level)
- transformation
- calling (unless directly in the text)
- mission (unless directly in the text)

> These words may appear **inside the Bible passage**, but not in the interface.

---

## 5. The Discovery Test

Before approving any study-level text, ask:

### The Three Questions

1. Does this tell people what they should conclude?
2. Does this assume agreement or belief?
3. Would this still make sense to someone new to the Bible?

If the answer is **yes** to any question, rewrite.

---

## 6. The Creation → Church Test

Every new study should pass this comparison:

> _Could this summary sit next to “The Storm” or “The Garden” without feeling different in tone?_

If not, the text is too instructional.

---

## 7. Example: Disciple (House-Style Compliant)

```json
{
  "study": {
    "code": "disciple",
    "title": "Disciple",
    "summary": "What did Jesus invite His followers into—and what might that mean today?",
    "intro": "Jesus often spoke about following Him using stories, images, and strong words. This study explores those moments."
  }
}
```

## 8. Where Vision Belongs

Vision is not removed — it is relocated.

Vision **belongs** in:

- Trainer notes
- Leader onboarding
- Emails
- About pages
- Coaching conversations

Vision does **not** belong in:

- Study selectors
- Lesson titles
- First-time user interfaces

Study-level text should invite people to encounter Scripture, not persuade them toward outcomes.

---

## 9. One-Page Rule for Contributors

Use this rule when writing or reviewing study-level text:

> **Write as if you’re inviting someone to read the Bible with you — not explaining what the Bible says.**

If the text sounds like a sermon, training manual, or strategy document, rewrite it.

---

## 10. Summary

Study-level text should:

- Invite rather than instruct
- Create space for discovery
- Keep authority with the Bible
- Remain accessible across cultures

When in doubt:

- Remove conclusions
- Shorten sentences
- Replace abstractions with observation

Clarity comes from restraint.
